# Componentizing the countdown block

## Introduction

In this step, the _app_ has two main elements: the title and the countdown. However, in order to obtain greater positioning and customization flexibility, it is interesting that they are separated into two distinct blocks. For this, it is necessary to briefly introduce the concept of interfaces, and then a new `Title` component will be developed. An example of customization in terms of positioning, which will be covered in this step, is:

> What if I wanted the title to be under or beside the counter?

## Interface

An interface works like a contract, with well-defined restrictions on how the blocks will work together. It then defines a mapping that creates a Store Framework block, from a React component. It is important to highlight that the use of interfaces, in order to separate an _app_ in several interfaces, makes the customization power much greater.

When defining an _app_ in the interface, the `component` property is responsible for defining the React component that will be used. It is important to note that the name of `component` must be the same as the file name of the component inside the `react/` folder.

`interfaces.json` examples:

```json
{
  "countdown": {
    "component": "Countdown"
  }
}
```

Now, you are going to separate the title from the countdown block and add it to the store below the countdown.

### Altering the `Countdown` component

1. First, remove the _imports_, the `title` from the interface and change the CSS _handles_ const, `CSS_HANDLES`:

    ```diff
    //react/Countdown.tsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react'
    import { TimeSplit } from './typings/global'
    import { tick, getTwoDaysFromNow } from './utils/time'
    import { useCssHandles } from 'vtex.css-handles'
    -import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl'

    interface CountdownProps {
      targetDate: string,
    -  title: string
    }

    const DEFAULT_TARGET_DATE = getTwoDaysFromNow()
    -const CSS_HANDLES = ['container', 'countdown', 'title']
    +const CSS_HANDLES = ['countdown']
    ```

2. Now, in the component itself, remove the `title` as a _prop_ given and also the title text constant, which changes what is being rendered:

    ```diff
    //react/Countdown.tsx
    const Countdown: StorefrontFunctionComponent<CountdownProps> = ({
    - title,
      targetDate = DEFAULT_TARGET_DATE,
    }) => {
      const [
        timeRemaining,
        setTime
      ] = useState<TimeSplit>({
        hours: '00',
        minutes: '00',
        seconds: '00'
      })

    - const titleText = title || <FormattedMessage id="countdown.title" />
      const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)

      tick(targetDate, setTime)

      return (
    -   <div className={`${handles.container} t-heading-2 fw3 w-100 pt7 pb6 c-muted-1 db tc`}>
    -     <div className={`${handles.title} db tc`}>
    -       { titleText }
    -     </div>
          <div className={`${handles.countdown} db tc`}>
            {`${timeRemaining.hours}:${timeRemaining.minutes}:${timeRemaining.seconds}`}
          </div>
    -   </div>
      )
    }
    ```

3. At last, remove the title from the _schema_:

    ```diff
    //react/Countdown.tsx
    Countdown.schema = {
      title: 'editor.countdown.title',
      description: 'editor.countdown.description',
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
    -   title: {
    -     title: 'I am a title',
    -     type: 'string',
    -     default: null,
    -   },
        targetDate: {
          title: 'Final date',
          description: 'Final date used in the countdown',
          type: 'string',
          default: null,
        },
      },
    }
    ```

### Creating a new component

1. Create a new file in the `/react` directory, named `Title.tsx`, it will be the new title component. In it, some _imports_ are needed. The basic structure of the code is very similar to the `Countdown` component's. Afer doing that, add the _imports_ needed and the CSS _handles_ constant:

    ```tsx
    //react/Title.tsx
    import React from "react"
    import { FormattedMessage } from "react-intl"
    import { useCssHandles } from "vtex.css-handles"

    const CSS_HANDLES = ["title"] as const
    ```

2. Now, it's necessary to change the component's function:

    ```tsx
    //react/Title.tsx
    const Title: StorefrontFunctionComponent<TitleProps> = ({ title }) => {
      const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)
      const titleText = title || <FormattedMessage id="countdown.title" />

      return (
        <div
          className={`${handles.title} t-heading-2 fw3 w-100 c-muted-1 db tc`}
        >
          {titleText}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

3. At last, add the interface, the _schema_ and the _export_:

    ```tsx
    //react/Title.tsx
    interface TitleProps {
      title: string
    }

    Title.schema = {
      title: "editor.countdown-title.title",
      description: "editor.countdown-title.description",
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        title: {
          title: "I am a title",
          type: "string",
          default: null,
        },
      },
    }

    export default Title
    ```

### Changing the `interfaces.json` file

By now, there are two components in the _app_: the title and the countdown. However, it is necessary to change the `interfaces.json` file, which is in the `store` folder. It is needed to declare each one separately. At first, our interface only contained the `Countdown`. It is needed to add the other component:

```diff
{
  "countdown": {
    "component": "Countdown"
  },
+   "countdown.title": {
+     "component": "Title"
+   }
}
```

### Adding internationalization

It is also needed to add to the _Messages_ the translations whose keys are the _strings_ of the _schema_ that we included in the `Title.tsx` file above. As seen in the _Messages_ step, go to the `/messages` folder, and add the necessary translations to each file (`pt.json`, `es.json` and `en.json`). Below is an example for the case of the `en.json` file:

```diff
 {
   "countdown.title": "Countdown",
   "editor.countdown.title": "Countdown",
   "editor.countdown.description": "Countdown component",
+  "editor.countdown-title.title": "Countdown title",
+  "editor.countdown-title.description": "Title component",
 }
```

### Adding the new block to the store home

Finally, to see the changes, go back to the theme to change it to include the new block. To do so, simply add the title to _home_! Same as the countdown, it is necessary to add `countdown.title` as a block in the theme of your store, in the store-theme file `home.jsonc`.

```diff
//home.jsonc
 {
   "store.home": {
     "blocks": [
       "countdown",
+      "countdown.title",
       ...
     ]
   },
   ...
 }
```

Done! Now let's see how the result should look like:
