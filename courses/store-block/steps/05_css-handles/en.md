# Modifying the countdown block to have configurable styles

## Introduction

Now that we have implemented the `countdown`, how about adding a little customization? In this step, you will learn basic concepts about CSS _handles_ and Tachyons to customize the style of your _app_.

### CSS Handles

CSS _handles_ are used to customize your store's components through CSS classes in the theme code. All settings are defined through the _app_ `vtex.css-handles`, responsible for declaring all the customization points of your block.

By defining the names of your _handles_ and adding them to their respective HTML elements, it is possible to give the theme's user customization points that allow them to create flexible _layouts_.

### Tachyons

Tachyons is a _framework_ for functional CSS. Unlike other known _frameworks_, like Bootstrap, it does not have "pre-built" UI components. In fact, its purpose is, precisely, separate the CSS rules into small, reusable parts. This type of strategy is commonly known as _Subatomic Design System_ and, if you are interested, you can find a reference [in this link](https://daneden.me/2018/01/05/subatomic-design-systems/). This strategy makes _frameworks_ like Tachyons very flexible, scalable and fast.

A lot of the Tachyons' definitions can be changed, so that your store will have a more customized style. To do this, just define a JSON file in the `styles/configs` folder; this information can be found in more detail at: [Customizing styles on VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-io-documentation-5-customizingstyles).

## Customizing your block

1. First, import the `useCssHandles` _hook_. To do so, return to `Countdown.tsx` and do the _import_:

    ```tsx
    // react/Countdown.tsx
    import { useCssHandles } from "vtex.css-handles"
    ```

2. Now, define in a _Array_ all necessary _handles_ (in this case, only `'countdown'` will be used):

    ```tsx
    // react/Countdown.tsx
    const CSS_HANDLES = ["countdown"]
    ```

3. After defining the array, let's use the `useCssHandles` in the component `Countdown` to define the `countdown` _handle_:

    ```diff
    // react/Countdown.tsx
    const Countdown: StorefrontFunctionComponent<CountdownProps> = ({ targetDate = DEFAULT_TARGET_DATE }) => {
      const [timeRemaining, setTime] = useState<TimeSplit>({
        hours: '00',
        minutes: '00',
        seconds: '00'
      })

    + const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)

      tick(targetDate, setTime)

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>
            { `${timeRemaining.hours}:${timeRemaining.minutes}:${timeRemaining.seconds}` }
          </h1>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

4. At last, it is needed to use the _handle_ in the component to see the customization. For this, use the prop `className` with the classes to be used and the Tachyons classes, for global styles.

    ```diff
    // react/Countdown.tsx
    import React from 'react'
    ...

    const Countdown: StorefrontFunctionComponent<CountdownProps> = ({ targetDate = DEFAULT_TARGET_DATE }) => {
      const [timeRemaining, setTime] = useState<TimeSplit>({
        hours: '00',
        minutes: '00',
        seconds: '00'
      })

      const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)

      tick(targetDate, setTime)

      return (
    +   <div className={`${handles.countdown} c-muted-1 db tc`}>
          {`${timeRemaining.hours}:${timeRemaining.minutes}:${timeRemaining.seconds}`}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

Let's see the result?
