# Making the countdown block customizable

## Introduction

Now we have an `h1` element rendered, it's possible to use it to display information that depends on the component's properties (*props*). For that, some concepts will be shown, given that they are essential for app development. 

## Changing the content rendered on the component

1. In the interface defined in `Countdown.tsx`, add a *prop* called `targetDate`, its type is *string*. We are, hence, defining a component *prop* that will be used to initialize the countdown.

    ```diff
    // react/Countdown.tsx
    interface CountdownProps {
    +   targetDate: string    
    }
    ```

2. Now, we need to use it on the component, substituting the text used previously, `Countdown Test`, for another, using *Site Editor*.

    >Keep in mind that `targetDate` will be used to define the countdown ending date. However, for now, it will work as a dummy field.

    First, change the component in order for it to use the `targetDate` prop. To do that, you need to use its variable inside the `h1` of the React component.

    ```tsx
    // react/Countdown.tsx
    const Countdown: StorefrontFunctionComponent<CountdownProps> = ({ targetDate }) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{ targetDate }</h1>
        </div>
      ) 
    }
    ```

3. Furthermore, to be able to edit this property through *Site Editor*, it's necessary to add that same prop to the **schema**. This is done by adding the `targetDate` key to the `properties` object of the **schema**:
    ```diff
    // react/Countdown.tsx
    Countdown.schema = {
      title: 'editor.countdown.title',
      description: 'editor.countdown.description',
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
    +   targetDate: {
    +      title: 'Final date',
    +      description: 'Final date used in the countdown',
    +      type: 'string',
    +      default: null,
    +   },
      },
    }
    ```

All set! Now you can change the text content through *Site Editor*.
> You can go to the Site Editor by accessing the following link: `{yourWorkspace}--appliancetheme.myvtex.com/admin/cms/site-editor`.

Go ahead to the *Site Editor* and click on `Countdown` on the side menu, this will open an edit menu, like the shown below:

Now, in the field below the title, type the date in the format `AAAA-MM-DD` and see the change, that will then show the text you've typed!
