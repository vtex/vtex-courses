# Making your store unique

## Introduction
In order to introduce developers to how to build custom apps in VTEX IO, this course was launched. It goes through all the necessary steps to have a custom block in a theme that uses React, Typescript, and GraphQL.

## About this course
This course will guide you through learning how to develop a custom app with VTEX IO. At the end of it, you will have a fully functional app, which is a countdown block for your store.

There are some prerequisities for you to have an amazing experience when doing this tutorial, which are:

- Knowledge on React and how to use hooks

If you are not familiar with any of those tools, we encourage you to take a look in some documentation:
