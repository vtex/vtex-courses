# Service course challenge

## Proposal
Use the implementation of *query* GraphQL and its respective *resolver* previously implemented in this course to create a customized block. This block needs to be on the product page and use the data from the *query* to show the fictitious number of people viewing the product.

> Attention! For the sake of simplicity, abstract the `slug` mentioned earlier during the course, in order to consult the Master Data with` topN = 1` and use only the information in the `count` field.

The result should be similar to the image below:
