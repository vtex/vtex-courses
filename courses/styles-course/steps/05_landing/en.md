# Building a custom search landing page 

## Introduction

In the previous step, we looked at creating a custom template. In scenarios involving promotions and commemorative dates, it's quite common to create special *landing pages*. 

## Custom searches

We saw that the search deduces what is needed from the given context. On a custom page however, the context doesn't exist and you need to state which *query* should be performed to get the results. All this is made possible by the `search-result-layout.customQuery`.

## Query schema

The query schema is one of the [custom query search result props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-search-result) that allows you to control the search that the *landing page* should run. To know more the query schema's possibilities, read through its [documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-search-result#step-3---defining-how-the-search-query-data-should-be-fetched).

## Creating a new landing page

1. Define a new path (`store.custom#landing`) in `routes.json`;

    ```json
    // store/routes.json
    "store.custom#landing": {
        "path": "/landing"
    }
    ```

2. Create a new file called `search-landing.jsonc` in the blocks folder;
3. Create a new custom template entitled `store.custom#landing`;
4. Define the [`image`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-store-components-image) block as one of this template's blocks. This block must have `minWidth` props of 100% and an image of your choosing:

    ```json
        "store.custom#landing": {
            "blocks": [
                "image#landingbanner" 
            ]
        },
        "image#landingbanner": {
            "props": {
                "src": "https://storecomponents.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/box.png",
                "minWidth": "100%"
            }
        },
    ```

5. Add the `search-result-layout.customQuery` block:

    ```diff
    // store/blocks/search-landing.jsonc
    {
      "store.custom#landing": { 
        "blocks": [
          "image#landingbanner", 
    +     "search-result-layout.customQuery"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

6. Define the `search-result-layout.customQuery` block as the [*querySchema* prop](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-search-result#step-3---defining-how-the-search-query-data-should-be-fetched) that:
  - Sorts by latest release date;
  - Hides unavailable items;
  - Displays a max of 8 items per page;
  - Uses "Camera" as *query*.

    ```json
        "search-result-layout.customQuery": {
            "props": {
                "querySchema": {
                    "orderByField": "OrderByReleaseDateDESC",
                    "hideUnavailableItems": true,
                    "maxItemsPerPage": 8,
                    "queryField": "Blue Top Retro Camera",
                    "mapField": "ft"
                }
            }
        }
    ```
7. At this point, you're probably not seeing the block on the landing page. This is due to the facr that we have not add a block to the `search-result-layout.customQuery` yet. Here are two possibilities:

    - In case of having already done the previous courses, you probably have already changed the `search.jsonc` file in this template that we're using, in order to use the flex layout concept. Having it already done, it's only necessary to add the following code lines to the `search-landing.jsonc` file:

        ```diff
      // store/blocks/search-landing.jsonc
      {
        ...
        "search-result-layout.customQuery": {
            "props": {
                "querySchema": {
                    "orderByField": "OrderByReleaseDateDESC",
                    "hideUnavailableItems": true,
                    "maxItemsPerPage": 8,
                    "queryField": "Camera",
                    "mapField": "ft",
                    "skusFilter": "ALL_AVAILABLE"
                }
            },
      +     "blocks": [
      +       "search-result-layout.desktop"
      +     ]
        }
      }
      ```

    - In case of not having enrolled for the previous courses and the `search.jsonc` is empty, it's necessary to add blocks to it. To do that, you can use the code block below. After doing that, you'll only need to add the `search-result-layout.desktop` block to the blocks array of `search-result-layout.customQuery`, just as mentioned before.
    
        ```json
        // store/blocks/search.jsonc
        {
            "store.search": {
            "blocks": [
                "search-result-layout"
            ]
            },
            "search-result-layout": {
            "blocks": [
                "search-result-layout.desktop",
                "search-result-layout.mobile",
                "search-not-found-layout"
            ]
            },
            "search-result-layout.desktop": {
            "children": [ 
                "breadcrumb.search",
                "search-title.v2",
                "flex-layout.row#top",
                "search-fetch-previous",
                "flex-layout.row#results",
                "search-fetch-more"
            ],
            "props":{
                "pagination": "showMore"
            }
            },
            "flex-layout.row#top": {
            "children": [
                "total-products.v2",
                "order-by.v2"
            ]
            },
            "flex-layout.row#results": {
            "children": [
                "flex-layout.col#filter",
                "flex-layout.col#search"
            ]
            },
            "flex-layout.col#filter": {
            "props": {
                "width": "20%"
            },
            "children": [
                "filter-navigator.v3"
            ]
            },
            "flex-layout.col#search": {
            "children": [      
                "search-content"
            ]
            }
        }
        ```
        > Neste caso, aproveite para observar com calma o código adicionado, de forma que você se assegure de que entendeu as relações entre os blocos e a função de cada um.

The expected result is:
