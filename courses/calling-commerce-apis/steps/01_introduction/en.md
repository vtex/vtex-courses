# Calling VTEX Commerce APIs through VTEX IO

## Introduction

In this course, you will learn some basic concepts about **VTEX Commerce APIs** and also how to use them in your application running on VTEX IO.

## Requirements

- It is important that you have completed the **VTEX IO Service Course**, which explains how backend services works within VTEX IO.
- We also hope that you have learned the concept of _Client_ in the services.

## What will you learn?

- How to find references about VTEX Commerce APIs.
- How to authenticate to make calls to APIs.
- How to reuse _Clients_ available in the community.
- How to use these _Clients_ to make requests in a VTEX IO application.

## Activity
To exercise the concepts learned in this course, it is necessary that you have the `vtex.service-example` app available locally, also used in the Services course.

So, if you don't already have this application on your computer:

1. Clone the `vtex-apps / service.example` repository with the command: `git clone https://github.com/vtex-apps/service-example`.

2. Inside the app folder, run `vtex link` to check if the app builds normally. You should receive a link to a public route that the code exposes.
